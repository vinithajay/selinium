Answers

1)The main method in java:
      Java main method is the entry point of any java program. Its syntax is always public static void main(String[] args) . You can only change the name of String 
array argument, for example you can change args to myStringArgs.

2)The different  Control flow Statements available in java:
      1.Decision making statement 
        if statement
        if-else statement 
     2.Looping statement 
        For
        while
     3.Jumping statement
        continue 
        break
     4.Looping statement

3) The Difference betweeen break and continue statements:
      The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately. The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop. break keyword 
is used to indicate break statements in java programming.

4)Array:
     Array is a group of similar datatype in the same data type. We declare an array in
Java as we do other variables, by providing a type and name: int[] myArray.

5) ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
      ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when we access an array, or a Collection, that is backed by an array with an invalid index. This means that the index 
is either less than zero or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

6)
   What are the naming conventions to be followed while creating a class, 
method and a variable.Explain with examoles

   ClassName object=new ClassName();
  * Classname---- should start with uppercase.
  * Methodname---- should start with lowercase and follwed by uppercase suchas firstname()
  * Variablename---- should start with lowercase and follwed by uppercase suchas lastname().

7)Variable:
  Variables are contains for storing data values.
    type variableName=value;

8) String in java:
    Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters.
It is not a primitive data type.

9)The different ways to create the String Object in java:
    
  By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=�Welcome�;
  
  By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword �new�. For example: String s=new String(�Welcome�);

10)The Difference between .Equals and ==:
  The major difference between the == operator and . equals() method is that one is an operator, and the other is the method. 
Both these == operators and equals() are used to compare objects to mark equality.
