1)Selinium:
      Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming 
languages like Java.
  Selenium components:
      1.Selenium IDE 
      2.Selenium RC
      3.Selenium WebDriver 
      4.Selenium RC
  Selenium Webdriver:
      Selenium Webdriver is an open-source collection of APIs which is used for testing web applications. The Selenium Webdriver tool is used for
 automating web application testing to verify that it works as expected or not. It mainly supports browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer.

2) communication flow between webdriver and broswer :
     1.For each Selenium command, a HTTP request is created and sent to the browser driver

     2.The browser driver uses a HTTP server for getting the HTTP requests

     3.The HTTP server determines the steps needed for implementing the Selenium command

     4.The implementation steps are executed on the browser

     5.The execution status is sent back to the HTTP server

     6.The HTTP server sends the status back to the automation script

3)The locators available  to find an element using Selenium are,
  1.Id 
  2.Name
  3.class
  4.linktext
  5.Partial Link Text
  6.tagname
  7.CssSelector
  8.xpath

4)
   By.ID()is the faster technique because at its root, the call goes down to document. getElementById(), which is optimized by most browsers. 
But, finding elements using XPath is better for locating elements having complex selectors, and is no doubt the most
flexible selection strategy.

5) select value in dropdown:
      A dropdown is represented by <select> tag and the options are represented by <option> tag. To select an option with its value we have to use
 the selectByValue method and pass the value attribute of the option that we want to select as a parameter to that method. 

6) Absolute Path:
        It contains the complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
   Relative Xpath:
        This is more like starting simply by referencing the element you want and go from the particular location. 
You use always the Relative Path for testing of an element.

7)How to verify if the given check box is checked or not ?
   In order to check if a checkbox is checked or unchecked, we can used the isSelected() method over the checkbox element. 
The isSelected() method returns a boolean value of true if the checkbox is checked false otherwise. 

8)System.setProperty:
      System.setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path.The Selenium client library communicates with the ChromeDriver via the JSON Wire Protocol. The Chrome browser driver 
acts like a link between the Selenium implementation code and the Chrome browser.
  WebDriverManager:
      WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. By default, it downloads the latest version of the browser binary 
and also the binary for the appropriate platform. We have to add the dependency for WebDriverManager in case the code belongs to Maven or Gradle environment.

10)To get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver:
          We can get the attribute of element in Selenium webdriver.The getAttribute() method is used to obtain the value of an attribute in an html document. 
In an html code, attribute and its value appear as a key value pair.
